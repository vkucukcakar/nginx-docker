		# Fastcgi cache purge
		##

		# * fastcgi_cache_purge is available as part of nginx commercial subscription (See http://nginx.org/en/docs/http/ngx_http_fastcgi_module.html#fastcgi_cache_purge )
		# * Note that its usage is different than the old fastcgi_cache_purge that comes with 3rd party module http://labs.frickle.com/nginx_ngx_cache_purge/
		# * Of course you can use other 3rd party solutions or just forget about cache purging and use smaller cache timeouts for dynamic pages
